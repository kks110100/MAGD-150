## Example 2 : Lab 3

Project: The theme of the project was bubbles. In order to adhere to the theme and the requirements of the assignment, I had the bubbles I created with ellipses follow the mouse with various variables to determine how each bubble moved.

## Examples 3 : Lab 5

Project: The theme of the project was television. To adhere to the requirements of the assignment, I created a television and created 'on' and 'off' buttons that'd change the brightness of the screen depending on what button was clicked.

## Example 4 : Lab 6

Project: The theme of the project was Retro Games. For this assignment, I recreated pacman and the ghosts that follow him. I had the pacman rest in the middle of the canvas while the ghosts circled him at various speeds, distances, and rotations. Additionally, I decided to dabble in the philosophy of art by creating a black bubble that consumes pacman and the ghosts to represent the all consuming greed possessed by the characters.

## Example 5 : Lab 7

Project: The theme of the project was Nature. I recreated a scene outside my window of bugs attempting to reach the light of my room at night but the window prevented them from entering so they gathered in a frenzy as they attempted to enter the room despite the barrier.
